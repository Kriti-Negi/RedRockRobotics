                <p>To Red Rock Robotics, FIRST means more than winning competitions. Instead, FIRST is about inspiring and educating the future generation about STEM and the amazing opportunities waiting after high school. Red Rock as a team has made a commitment to increasing accessibility to STEM education to ALL children regardless of age, race, gender, and economic status. This has been the driving goal for our outreach especially during the pandemic, where many existing opportunities for students have been lost.  Every member is dedicated to this goal and has played a part in the impact that Red Rock has been able to make</p>
